**A standardized technical due diligence framework for auditing AI vendors before procurement.**

Designed for CTOs and Risk Officers in the **UK, Switzerland, and EU** who need to ensure data sovereignty and model safety.

## 🚀 How to use this
1. **Download** the `AI_Vendor_Due_Diligence_Questionnaire.md` file.
2. **Send it** to any AI startup or vendor you are evaluating.
3. **Score** their answers against the "Red Flag" criteria listed below.

## ⚠️ The "Kill" Criteria (Red Flags)
Reject the vendor immediately if:
* 🔴 They cannot list all Sub-processors (data residency risk).
* 🔴 They do not have a separate "Zero Data Retention" API agreement.
* 🔴 They refuse to provide a System Card or SOC2 Type II report.

## 🏛️ Need an Expert Review?
This repository is maintained by **Cata Financial LLC.**.
I provide a **48-hour Technical "Go/No-Go" Assessment** for enterprise clients. I verify the vendor's claims so you don't inherit their risk.
